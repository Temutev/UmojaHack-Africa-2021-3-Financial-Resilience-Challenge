# UmojaHack-Africa-2021-3-Financial-Resilience-Challenge
This world is full of uncertainty. Financial resilience is the ability to withstand and recover from temporary, unexpected life events that can cause financial hardship. These events can include unemployment, divorce, disability, and health problems.  As we move into the second year of the global pandemic, resilience matters now more than ever.  This challenge asks you to build a machine learning model to predict which individuals across Africa and around the world are most likely to be financially resilient or not.  This solution will provide insight into peopleâ€™s financial behaviors and resilience, which can help financial services providers including insurance companies and banks tailor their services to give their clients the best chance possible to achieve financial resilience.
